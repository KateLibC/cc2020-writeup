It's a beautiful day at t

al match is about to take place. The cr
owd starts to cheer for these competito
rs as Jolene makes her way to center st
age with her microphone in her hand. Sh
e said, "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome 
to the main event of the day! It's time
 to find out who will be crowned the ch

The crowd cheered as Jolene continues

et's get started. In the blue corner, w

nce at the title. Please give it up for
 the Koopa Krusher!"

A blue spotlight 
shined down towards the arena and in st
eps the Koopa Krusher, ready to do batt
le against Yoshi. Jolene walked in and 
asked him, "So, Koopa Krusher, how does
 it feel to be back in the arena for an
other chance?"

The Koopa Krusher repli
ed, "It feels so good to be back in the
 ring and if I win today, then I'll be 
crowned the new champion and I'm so gla
d to have the fans cheer for me through
out the match so, it feels great!"

"I 
see. Now, do you have some moves for us
 to show?"

"I do! Here's one, Krusher 
Shell Spin!"

Then he spun in his shell
 and the crowd loved it. Koopa Krusher 
came out and said, "Ta-da!"

The crowd 
cheered as Jolene said, "Wow, that was 
amazing! Now, are you ready for the cha
llenger?"

"YES!" the crowd cheered.

"
Alright then. Let's meet today's challe
nger! Our challenger is everyone's favo
rite fighter in the Glitz Pit. He's kno

 way to today's final match and now, he
's here in the red corner. And now, mak
ing his way to the arena in the red cor

A re
d spotlight shined down on the arena an
d the fog machine started up. The doors
 open up and in steps the egg. When the
 egg hatched, Yoshi has appeared from t
he egg and received the biggest applaus
e from the crowd. The crowd said, "Yosh
i, Yoshi, Yoshi!"

Jolene walked in to 
him and said, "Yoshi, welcome to the ch
ampionship match and you still have you
r trademark green and white battle suit
 for this match. How does it feel?"

Yo

ry happy to be here for the final round
 and I can't wait for the gong to sound
. This is going to be the best fight I'
ll ever have and I'm ready to go with m
y trademark Yoshi Egg Cannon!"

"Now, a
ccording to your profile card, it said 
that you used your tongue to eat enemie
s. Is that true?" Jolene asked.

"Yes! 
My tongue can eat anything and I still 
have my Yoshi Egg Cannon. Ready to see 
it?"

"Go ahead, fire away!"

"Alright!
 Yoshi Egg Cannon... Attack!"

Then, th
e cannon fired an egg and it hit the ta
rget. The crowd cheered as Yoshi said, 
"Direct hit!"

"Wow, that was amazing! 
Yoshi, good luck out there and thanks f
or showing me your trademark Egg Cannon
."

"Anytime, Jolene!" Yoshi replied as
 the crowd cheered.

"OK, now that we m
et our two amazing fighters, it's time 
for the rules of this amazing bout and 
here to tell the rules of the fight is 
our referee, Shy Guy!"

Shy Guy came in
 and replied, "Thanks, Jolene. Now this

match and of course, you can attack you
r opponent with your super attack. We w

"T

"Th

 a thumbs up, "I'm ready to go!"

"Koop

.

"I'm all set!" Koopa Krusher replied
.

"Alright then, the battle begins whe

"YES!
" the crowd cheered.

"Then let's get t

Shy Guy agreed as the match is abo

Krusher, good luck to the both of you a

The crowd cheered for Shy Gu
y when they saw the trophy. Then Shy Gu
y said, "And now, it's the moment that 
everyone's been waiting for! It's time 
to start the final match. It's Yoshi vs
. Koopa Krusher! Are you ready?"

"Yes.
" The crowd said.

"I can't hear you. I
 said, are you ready?"

"YES!" the crow
d cheered.

"Now that's more like it! A
ll right then, here we go!"

Then Shy G
uy took out his hammer and said these f
amous words that will start the match, 
"Ready..."

Yoshi and the Koopa Krusher
 took their fighting positions as the b
attle is about to begin.

"Set..."

The
 stadium grew very silent as they await
 for the sound of the gong.

And then..
.

And then...

It's time to start the 
match. Shy Guy held his breath, raised 
his hammer, and said the only word that
 will hit the gong and start the match 
but... the fighters aren't fighting. Sh
y Guy sighed and said, "Guys, wake up. 
The match hasn't started. Why aren't yo
u fighting?"

"Because, you forgot to h
it the gong." Yoshi said, "You can't st
art the match without the gong."

"Oh, 
I forgot the gong. Of course. I left it
 there when I got here but, there's no 
gong for me to hit. Yoshi, could you do
 me a favor and use your tongue to fetc
h me the gong?" Shy Guy asked.

"You go
t it! One gong to start the match for S
hy Guy, coming up!" Yoshi replied as he
 used his tongue.

Then using his tongu
e, Yoshi has found the gong. Yoshi smil
ed and said, "Shy Guy, I found the gong
! It was at the major-league locker roo
m. Now we can start the match!"

"That'
s great, Yoshi. Bring it in so we can b
attle!"

"With pleasure! Tongue, back t
o the arena!"

Then, using his tongue, 
Yoshi has brought the gong to the arena
. Yoshi smiled and said, "Here it is, S
hy Guy! One official Glitz Pit gong, re
ady to be hit at anytime!"

"Thanks, Yo
shi!" Shy Guy replied, "I'm so glad tha
t you found it. Well, now that the gong
 has been found, I think we could start
 the match but, something's missing. I 
think I forgot the only word that will 
start the match. Now, which word is it?
"

Koopa Krusher thought for a moment a
nd said, "Is it fit?"

"No."

Yoshi smi
led to Shy Guy and said, "Fight?"

"Of 
course! I forgot to say fight. Thanks, 
Yoshi! You're the best fighter the aren
a has ever seen. Now then, may I do the
 honors by hitting the gong?" Shy Guy a
sked them.

Yoshi and Koopa Krusher too
k their fighting positions and said the
se words at the same time, "Shy Guy, hi
t the... GONG!"

Shy Guy smiled at them
 back and said, "Alright then, here it 
comes. And Yoshi?"

"Yes, Shy Guy." Yos
hi replied.

"Thank you for finding the
 gong."

"Anytime!"

"Ladies and gentle
men, the gong has been found thanks to 
Yoshi! Let's give it up for the Dino Fi
ghter!" Shy Guy announced.

The crowd c
heered for Yoshi as Shy Guy hugged him 
for his good deed. Then he said, "Now t
hen, are you ready to do battle Yoshi?"


"Am I ready? That's a great question.
 Let me answer that question with one s
ingle word."

"And that single word is.
.."

"YES!"

"Alright then. If you're r
eady, 3, 2, 1..."

Shy Guy took out his
 hammer, raised it up, and then, he sai
d the word...

"Fight."

But, the fight
ers aren't moving. Shy Guy shrugged and
 said, "Guys, I said fight. The match h
as started. Why aren't you fighting?"


"Because, the crowd is silent." Yoshi r
eplied.

"But how?"

"Your voice is not
 loud enough for the crowd."

"Oh! So y
ou want me to say the word louder so th
e crowd can hear me?"

"YEAH! If you sa
y it louder, then everyone can hear you
! Even us!"

"You know, this idea just 
might work and I'm feeling better than 
ever now! Thanks, Yoshi!"

"Anytime, re
f. Anytime! Well, what are you waiting 
for? I can't stay in my battle position
 for another few seconds! Hurry, Shy Gu
y! The crowd is getting restless here a
nd we are still waiting for your call! 
Now, Shy Guy. Say the word and let's ge
t started!" Yoshi said to the referee.


Shy Guy agreed with his idea and took 
out his hammer. Then he said, "Alright 
then, here it comes! 3, 2, 1... FIGHT!"


And then, the gong has sounded and th
e fighters rushed in to each other with
 the crowd cheering.

When Shy Guy was 
finished with the gong, he said to Yosh
i, "There! Happy?"

"YEAH! You're back 
to your own self now because you said t
he word louder! Thanks!"

"Anytime! Wel
l, what are you waiting for? I've alrea
dy hit the gong so that means that you 
should go and attack the Koopa Krusher 
right now." Shy Guy said to him, "Remem
ber, the fighter who gets knocked out l
oses and the championship trophy is sti
ll at stake. So, go get 'em!"

"Now, Sh
y Guy?" Yoshi asked.

"Yes, Yoshi! FIGH
T!" Shy Guy agreed and gave him a thumb
s up.

"Oh, right! And with that from y
ou, I'm off! Yoshi Opening... RUSH!"

A
nd with that, the championship match ha
s officially begun!

Yoshi started the 
match with his trademark eggs while the
 Koopa Krusher spun in his shell to blo
ck his attack. Then he attacked Yoshi w
ith his shell and said, "You're having 
a shell of a time! Shell Smash!"

Yoshi
 smiled and replied, "Egg Shield!"

The
n Yoshi shielded in his egg as the Shel
l Smash attack was backfired. The crowd
 saw the egg and cheered for Yoshi as t
he battle heats up. Even Jolene was imp
ressed with Yoshi's Egg Shield and said
, "Wow, Yoshi's Egg Shield has blocked 
the Shell Smash! This is going to be a 
great match!"

As the battle continues,
 Yoshi and the Koopa Krusher are giving
 everything they got. Eggs, punches, sh
ells, you name it!

When the battle is 
about to end, the Koopa Krusher said, "
Well, it looks like this battle has rea
ched its end, Yoshi! Farewell! Finishin
g Attack: Final Koopa Krusher Spin!"

T
hen he spun in his shell and sped his w
ay towards Yoshi. This was it, the atta
ck to end the match.

"Oh, no! Koopa Kr
usher is aiming at Yoshi with his final
 attack, the Final Koopa Krusher Spin! 
If this attack collides with Yoshi, the
n it's all over, unless Yoshi has somet
hing to do to save the match! He saved 
the match seven times in this tournamen
t. Can he make a big comeback and win t
he title? Only time will tell!" Jolene 
announced.

Yoshi closed his eyes and w
aited for the chance to strike. He took
 out his Egg Cannon and called out the 
super attack, "Signature Attack! Yoshi 
Final Egg Cannon!"

The crowd watched a
nd waited for the battle to come to an 
end as Yoshi charged up his egg cannon.
 Then he counted, "3, 2, 1..."

And the
n...

And then...

The cannon reached f
ull power. Yoshi held the cannon steady
, took aim at the Koopa Krusher and pul
led the trigger as he shouts out the si
gnature attack...

"FULL BLAST!"

And t
hen, the Egg Cannon fired a very big eg
g and sped its way towards the Koopa Kr
usher's final attack. When it got there
, it stopped the attack and hit the Koo
pa Krusher, dead on! The crowd saw the 
egg and cheered for Yoshi as the egg gr
ows bigger!

"There it is! The Yoshi Fi
nal Egg Cannon, Yoshi's super attack! L
ooks like Yoshi has saved the match onc
e again, folks! If this egg explodes on
 the Koopa Krusher, then this match wil
l come to an end. Here it comes..." Jol
ene announced as the egg engulfs the Ko
opa Krusher.

Yoshi covered his ears an
d said, "Well, Koopa Krusher, you were 
a great opponent but now, it's time for
 you to be scrambled with this closing 
attack. Enjoy the fireworks because thi
s attack ends the match right here, rig
ht now! Farewell! Yoshi Final Egg Canno
n... FINAL EXPLOSION!"

And with one fi
nal blast from the cannon, the egg expl
oded on the Koopa Krusher!

The blast s
ends him up to the ceiling and then, he
 fell down on the arena floor. The crow
d grew silent as Koopa Krusher stood up
. He said his final words, "That's the 
best attack I've ever seen. I can't tak
e it anymore! And with that final attac
k from you, I'm now... DEFEATED!"

And 
with his last word, he took his last br
eath and fell down unconscious. Koopa K
rusher was knocked out and the match ha
s ended.

Shy Guy took out his hammer, 
hits the gong and said, "Whoa! That was
 an impressive finale! I've never seen 
this finishing attack from Yoshi and th
e Koopa Krusher is now defeated! This i
s unbelievable, folks! One final attack
 finishes the job! So, that means... FI
NISH!"

Jolene looked at the battle and
 said, "Well, that was truly an impress
ive display of action in the arena. Pow
er vs. power, speed vs. strength, techn
ique vs. technique. This was truly the 
most impressive battle of the tournamen
t and the crowd loved it! But, there ca
n only be one grand champion in this fi
nal battle and that someone is... YOSHI
!"

Yoshi ran to Jolene and hugged her 
as confetti fell on the winner. With th
e crowd cheering, Jolene smiled to Yosh
i and said, "You did it, Yoshi! Congrat
ulations! I can't believe what just hap
pened here but your final attack makes 
you the Glitz Pit's Grand Champion! Let
's hear some noise for our grand champi

The crowd cheered even louder as 
Yoshi jumped for joy when Jolene heard 
the announcement. Jolene smiled and sai
d, "So, you've done it, buddy! Well don
e, champ! So, how does it feel to be cr
owned the grand champion?"

"It feels a
mazing!" Yoshi replied, "I thought I wa
s a goner but when I fired my Egg Canno
n, I turned the battle around and then.
.. BOOM! The Koopa Krusher was defeated
 and now, I'm the champion!"

"Of cours

replay before we give you the champions

"We shall do th

"OK, as soon as you fired
 the cannon, it sped its way to the Koo
pa Krusher. Then, the egg got bigger an
d stronger as you watch the attack come
s in full force. And finally, BOOM! The
 egg exploded on him and he fell down o

" Jolene said as the duo saw it on an i

The crowd saw it all an

Then Jolene said, "Ladies and gentleme
